### 0.1
  Implemented a terrible way of watching the log.
### 0.2
  Made it better. Now the console can report something on a positive result other than the result itself.
### 0.21
  Added debug command. Added environment variables.
### 0.22
  The script now knows when the mission has loaded up, when the user abandons the mission, or when they complete the mission. Added TODO.
### 0.25
  Changed the above parameters to be more unique.
### 0.3
  Added beeps so that the user doesn't have to keep staring at the script. Added an extra case for when Space-Mom changes her stupid mind.
### 0.31
  The script won't shut up about Space-Mom changing her dumb mind. Fixed it. Also added an option for the user to keep the script window in the fore.
### 0.32
  The question about keeping the window in fore was broken. Fixed it.
### 0.33
  Added window parameters so the window isn't ever larger than it needs to be. It's not locked, and the user can still manipulate it to their liking.
### 0.34
  Strongly considering changing the "Space-Mom is an idiot who can't make up her stupid dumb mind" jingle from 'Beethoven's 5th' to 'MeGaLoVaNiA'. No actual change.
### 0.4
  Added CHANGELOG.
### 0.42
  Changed script output to put the message's timestamp at the start of the message. Feels less organic, but it's easier to read.
### 0.5
  Added a bad-streak counter and a total attempts counter to know just much of your life you've wasted!
### 0.51
  More numbers!
### 0.52
  Removed bloat pertaining to stats "times something was found" etc.
### 0.53
  Search parameters are now displayed persistently! Changed introduction as it's not a given that the player is using default settings.
### 0.54
  Reverted v0.52. Turns out variables don't update when called as part of other variables ('";Get-Stats' would not change when its parts incremented, so all statistics stayed at zero.
### 0.55
  Fixed that?
### 0.60
  Actually fixed that. This is a milestone! Slow and clogged and barely holding itself together inside, but looks alright outside. Just like me frfr.
### 0.70
  Swapped out Read-Host (ask the user for input) to Switch (ask the user to make a choice) re:Stay-On-Top. Also added a couple of presets for the user to choose! Untested, prone to explode.
### 0.71
  Added default option to $luamode.
### 0.72
  Added support for Ayatan Sculptures. It pings three times. Need to figure that out.
